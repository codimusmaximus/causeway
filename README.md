# Causeway

A self-learning hooks system for Claude Code.

Causeway watches your Claude Code sessions and automatically learns your preferences. When you correct Claude or express a preference, Causeway captures it as a rule and enforces it in future sessions.

## How It Works

Causeway hooks into Claude Code's pre-tool and stop events. When a session ends, it analyzes the conversation for corrections or preferences and creates rules. Before each tool call, it checks those rules and blocks or warns Claude if needed.

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codimusmaximus/causeway/main/install.sh | bash
